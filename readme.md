## the pitch

I hated that I was spending more time figuring out what I could read, than reading actual content. I made a simple extension to remove Medium's premium content from my homepage to reduce my scanning efforts. This was an experiment on my part to learn more about building something valuable for my daily life. As a nice bonus, I don't have to worry about getting my hopes up when I see a cool title tied to a premium article anymore.

Check out my post on [Medium]() about the process

## todos

-   [ ] handle only premium content being shown before 3 free views are used
-   [ ] scale to other pages where classes are scrammbled 
-   [ ] optimize when scripts are being ran on the page
